### Creating a new layout

Making a new layout is really simple
- must always use compress to minify html
- then write html with templating in mine that should be use for other pages.
  - no absolute text writing for, like 'Hello this is my page, blah blah'
  - everything should be generic for the page to be use for other pages
  - use data files (!TODO LINK DATA FILES LINK) to fill information (templating again)
- write about it in the docs folder on how to use it
  - what an example of data file looks like
  - a picture maybe
